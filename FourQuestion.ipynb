Q4. How can we achieve data abstraction?

Data abstraction in programming refers to the concept of hiding complex implementation details and showing only the essential features of an object. In object-oriented programming, achieving data abstraction involves two main techniques:

1.Encapsulation:
Encapsulation involves bundling the data (attributes or properties) and methods (functions or behaviors) that operate on the data into a single unit, usually a class.
The class exposes only the necessary functionalities to interact with its data, hiding the internal implementation details.
Access to the data is controlled through well-defined interfaces, using methods or properties.

2.Abstract Classes or Interfaces:
Abstract classes or interfaces define a blueprint that specifies a set of methods or properties without providing the implementation.
Subclasses inherit from these abstract classes or implement these interfaces, providing concrete implementations for the abstract methods or properties.
This ensures that all subclasses adhere to a common structure, promoting consistency and abstraction.
