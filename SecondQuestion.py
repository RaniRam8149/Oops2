Q2. Differentiate between Abstraction and Encapsulation. Explain with an example.

Abstraction and encapsulation are two fundamental concepts in object-oriented programming, often used together but addressing different aspects of managing complexity in software design.

Abstraction:

1.Abstraction is the process of focusing on essential qualities while hiding unnecessary details.      It's about defining a model that captures only the necessary details without representing the entire complexity.
2.It emphasizes what an object does rather than how it does it.
3.Example: Consider the concept of a "Shape." Shapes can be abstracted into a class with properties like area() and perimeter() without specifying particular shapes like squares or circles. This abstraction focuses on common behaviors and properties shared by all shapes.
class Shape:
    def area(self):
        pass

    def perimeter(self):
        pass

Encapsulation:

1.Encapsulation refers to the bundling of data (attributes) and methods (functions or     procedures) that operate on the data into a single unit, i.e., a class. It's about hiding the internal state of an object and only exposing the necessary functionalities.
2.It helps in restricting direct access to some of the object's components, allowing modification only through well-defined interfaces.
3.Example: Using the concept of a "Bank Account," where the account details (like balance) are encapsulated within the class, and access to modify the balance is controlled through specific methods like deposit() and withdraw().
class BankAccount:
    def __init__(self, initial_balance):
        self.balance = initial_balance

    def deposit(self, amount):
        self.balance += amount

    def withdraw(self, amount):
        if self.balance >= amount:
            self.balance -= amount
        else:
            print("Insufficient funds")
